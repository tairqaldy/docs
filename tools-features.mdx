## Current Tools (v0.1.7)

### codearchitect_help

Discover available features and get usage guidance. **Start here!**

**Features:**
- Lists all available features with descriptions
- Shows usage patterns and examples
- Provides when-to-use guidance
- Feature-specific help available

**Usage:**
```bash
use codearchitect
```

```bash
use codearchitect store_session
```

See [API Reference](/api-reference/codearchitect-help) for details.

### store_session

Save AI conversation sessions as organized markdown files in topic-named folders.

**Features:**
- **Automatic export file detection** - Auto-detects Cursor/VS Code exports from `~/.codearchitect/exports/`
- **VS Code JSON support** - Full support for VS Code's complex JSON export format
- **Export filename matching** - Match specific export files by pattern
- Auto-organization by date (`~/.codearchitect/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD/topic-folder/`)
- Topic-named folders with `summary.md` and `full.md` files
- Smart topic extraction with redundant suffix removal
- Always saves to main folder (`~/.codearchitect/sessions/`)
- Optional project folder save with `projectDir` parameter

**Usage:**
```bash
# Recommended: Export chat first, then:
use codearchitect store_session
```

```bash
use codearchitect store_session topic: "authentication implementation"
```

```bash
use codearchitect store_session exportFilename: "resolve_mcp"
```

See [API Reference](/api-reference/store-session) for details.

### get_session

Retrieve stored AI conversation sessions with TOON format support.

**Features:**
- Get specific session by folder name (e.g., `authentication-implementation`)
- List all sessions (optionally filtered by date)
- **~40% token reduction** with TOON format
- Automatic format selection (`auto` mode)
- Support for limiting results
- Handles both folder-based (v0.1.5+) and legacy flat-file formats

**Usage:**
```bash
use codearchitect get_session
```

```bash
use codearchitect get_session authentication-implementation
```

```bash
use codearchitect get_session 2025-11-18
```
