## Sessions saved in wrong location

**Note:** Sessions are always saved to `~/.codearchitect/sessions/` (home directory). This is intentional and ensures reliable storage across all projects.

**If you want to also save to project folder:**
- Use `projectDir` parameter: `use codearchitect store_session projectDir: "/path/to/project"`
- This saves to both main folder (`~/.codearchitect/sessions/`) AND project folder (`project/.codearchitect/sessions/`)

**Main location:**
- Windows: `C:\Users\YourName\.codearchitect\sessions\`
- Linux/Mac: `~/.codearchitect/sessions/`

## Session files not being created

**Check:**
- Write permissions: `chmod -R u+w ~/.codearchitect/` (Linux/Mac)
- MCP server logs in IDE Output panel
- Main location exists: `~/.codearchitect/sessions/` (created automatically)
- Export folder exists: `~/.codearchitect/exports/` (for auto-detection)

## MCP server not starting

**Verify:**
```bash
npx -y codearchitect-mcp@latest  # Should run without errors
node --version                    # Should be v18+
```

**If using global install:**
```bash
codearchitect-mcp --version  # Should show version
npm install -g codearchitect-mcp  # Reinstall if missing
```

**Recommended:** Use `npx` method (no global install needed):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "codearchitect": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "codearchitect-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Topic extraction issues

Provide explicit `topic` parameter. Topics are limited to 50 characters.

## Permission errors

**Linux/Mac:** `chmod -R u+w ~/.codearchitect/`  
**Windows:** Check folder Properties → Security → Write permissions for `C:\Users\YourName\.codearchitect\`
