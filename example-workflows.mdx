## System Design

```
Store this conversation about designing our microservices architecture
```

Saves architecture decisions, trade-offs, and technology choices.

## Code Review

```
Save this code review session about implementing authentication
```

Documents review feedback, improvements, and best practices.

## Debugging

```
Store this debugging conversation about database performance issues
```

Builds a troubleshooting knowledge base for future reference.

## Architecture Decisions

```
Save this session with topic "ADR: Choosing PostgreSQL over MongoDB"
```

Tracks decision context, options, rationale, and consequences.

## Development Workflow

```
Store this conversation about setting up CI/CD pipeline
```

Captures setup steps, configuration, and troubleshooting tips.

## Team Knowledge Sharing

## Retrieving Sessions

### Get Specific Session

```
Get session session-20250115-143022-authentication-implementation.md
```

Retrieves a specific session with optimized format for LLM consumption.

### List Recent Sessions

```
List all sessions from 2025-01-15
```

Lists all sessions from a specific date, useful for reviewing daily work.

### Review Architecture Decisions

```
Get session session-20250115-143022-microservices-architecture.md
```

Retrieves stored architecture discussions for reference during design work.

## Token Optimization

The `get_session` tool automatically uses TOON format when retrieving sessions, providing ~40% token reduction when sending to LLMs:

```
Get session session-20250115-143022-authentication-implementation.md with format auto
```

This reduces API costs and improves response times when working with large conversation histories.
