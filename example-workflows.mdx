## Getting Started

**First time?** Just ask:

```
use codearchitect
```

This shows you all available features and how to use them. No memorization needed!

## System Design

```
use codearchitect store_session "microservices architecture design"
```

Saves architecture decisions, trade-offs, and technology choices in a readable folder structure:

```
.codearchitect/sessions/2025-11-18/
└── microservices-architecture-design/
    ├── summary.md    # Quick overview + key decisions
    └── full.md       # Complete conversation
```

## Code Review

```
use codearchitect store_session "authentication code review"
```

Documents review feedback, improvements, and best practices.

## Debugging

```
use codearchitect store_session "database performance debugging"
```

Builds a troubleshooting knowledge base for future reference.

## Architecture Decisions

```
use codearchitect store_session "ADR: Choosing PostgreSQL over MongoDB"
```

Tracks decision context, options, rationale, and consequences.

## Development Workflow

```
use codearchitect store_session "CI/CD pipeline setup"
```

Captures setup steps, configuration, and troubleshooting tips.

## Team Knowledge Sharing

```
use codearchitect store_session "GraphQL API implementation"
```

## Retrieving Sessions

### Get Help First

```
use codearchitect get_session
```

Shows you how to retrieve sessions and lists available options.

### Get Specific Session

```
use codearchitect get_session authentication-implementation
```

Retrieves a specific session by folder name with optimized format for LLM consumption.

### List Recent Sessions

```
use codearchitect get_session 2025-11-18
```

Lists all sessions from a specific date, useful for reviewing daily work.

### List All Sessions

```
use codearchitect get_session
```

Lists all available sessions across all dates.

### Review Architecture Decisions

```
use codearchitect get_session microservices-architecture-design
```

Retrieves stored architecture discussions for reference during design work.

## Folder Structure

Sessions are organized in readable topic folders:

```
your-project/
└── .codearchitect/
    └── sessions/
        └── 2025-11-18/
            ├── authentication-implementation/
            │   ├── summary.md    # Quick summary + key points
            │   └── full.md       # Complete conversation (JSON + readable)
            ├── database-migration/
            │   ├── summary.md
            │   └── full.md
            └── microservices-architecture-design/
                ├── summary.md
                └── full.md
```

## Token Optimization

The `get_session` tool automatically uses TOON format when retrieving sessions, providing ~40% token reduction when sending to LLMs:

```
use codearchitect get_session authentication-implementation
```

This reduces API costs and improves response times when working with large conversation histories.
